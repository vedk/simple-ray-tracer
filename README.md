# simple-ray-tracer
_(This project is not yet complete and is in progress)_

I came across the following book [The Ray Tracer Challenge by Jamis Buck](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/) and it seemed very interesting.
So I chose the C programming language and started implementing the ray tracer using the Phong model.
The book follows a very novel approach.
It does not give you the code directly.
Rather, it gives you the test cases which a correctly written implementation should pass.

As of now the code in this repo can only render a canvas with arbitrary pixels.
I indent to complete in a month or two.

This project is written in C and uses dynamic memory allocation.
**It is my goal to write a very efficient and fast implementation by doing memory management manually.**
I chose C instead of Java/Python/Golang as this would give me fine grained control over how exactly memory is allocated and freed.
Plus, I also wanted to strengthen my understanding of pointers in C.
